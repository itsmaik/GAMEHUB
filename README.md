This project is my very first one. Its purpose is to put into practice and showcase everything I learned about HTML and CSS during the first quarter of the course. Later on, we were tasked with adjusting it and implementing some new features using JavaScript and APIs.

## Description

For this project various aspects of front-end development were required, including:

The product list page should display a list of all products fetched from the API, and the user should be able to click on a product to view its details on a separate product detail page. It should be ensured that the product data is not hardcoded into the HTML, but instead fetched dynamically from the API to display the latest data. The API calls should include a loading indicator to show the user that data is being fetched. Additionally, it should be implemented error handling to catch any errors that may occur when fetching data and display an appropriate message on the page. Make sure that the pproject is tested thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected.
